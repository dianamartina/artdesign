A responsive modern website for an interior design company.

The webpage is built with semantic HTML5 and Bootstrap 5.

The first part of the page is a full-height carousel hero image from the Bootstrap 5 gallery.

In the main part, the icons are part of the Font Awesome gallery, all the transition effects are implemented with the Animated On Scroll Library (AOS), and the hover ones with CSS3.
From the tablet size, the navigation menu switches to a hamburger icon from the Tasty CSS-animated hamburgers library.
